- `[topic] performance optimization`

### 3. Code Examples

**What to research:**
- Real-world usage patterns
- Common implementation approaches
- Code snippets and templates
- Full example projects
- Integration examples

**Search strategies:**
- `[topic] code examples`
- `[topic] example project github`
- `[topic] common patterns`

## Research Quality Criteria

When evaluating sources, prioritize:

1. **Recency** - Information from the current year or latest version
2. **Authority** - Official documentation, well-known experts, established organizations
3. **Completeness** - Comprehensive coverage of the topic
4. **Practicality** - Real-world examples and actionable guidance
5. **Community validation** - High engagement, positive feedback, widespread adoption

## Information Extraction

For each source, extract:

- **Title** - Clear, descriptive title
- **Summary** - 2-3 sentence overview
- **Key points** - Bullet list of main takeaways
- **Code examples** - Relevant code snippets
- **URL** - Source link for reference
- **Date** - Publication or last update date

## Structuring Research Data

Organize findings into these categories:

```json
{
  "topic": "Topic name",
  "library_docs": [
    {
      "title": "Documentation title",
      "summary": "Brief overview",
      "url": "Source URL",
      "key_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2"],
      "date": "2025-01-01"
    }
  ],
  "best_practices": [
    {
      "category": "Security",
      "description": "Practice description",
      "guidelines": ["Guideline 1", "Guideline 2"],
      "source": "URL"
    }
  ],
  "code_examples": [
    {
      "title": "Example title",
      "description": "What it demonstrates",
      "code": "Code snippet",
      "language": "python",
      "source": "URL"
    }
  ],
  "architectural_patterns": [
    {
      "name": "Pattern name",
      "description": "Pattern overview",
      "use_cases": ["Use case 1", "Use case 2"],
      "trade_offs": "Pros and cons",
      "source": "URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Research Depth Guidelines

**Quick research** (20-30 minutes):
- 3-5 sources per category
- Focus on official docs and top results
- Basic patterns and examples

**Medium research** (1-2 hours):
- 10-15 sources per category
- Include community resources and tutorials
- Multiple code examples and patterns
- Best practices coverage

**Deep research** (3-4 hours):
- 20+ sources per category
- Comprehensive coverage of all aspects
- Multiple architectural patterns
- Edge cases and advanced topics
- Performance and security deep-dives

## Iterative Refinement

After initial research:

1. **Identify gaps** - What's missing or unclear?
2. **Targeted searches** - Fill specific knowledge gaps
3. **Cross-reference** - Validate information across sources
4. **Consolidate** - Merge similar findings
5. **Prioritize** - Focus on most relevant information
