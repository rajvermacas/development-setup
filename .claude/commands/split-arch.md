description: Split the architecture plan document into 4 mutually exclusive logically separated documents from MVP iterative feature development point of view.

I have got an architecture plan document $ARGUMENTS
I want you to read it carefully and divide the document into 4 mutually exclusive logically separated from MVP iterative feature development point of view. Clearly mention what are all the features/responsibilities that each document is going to cover and which ones are excluded from which document and at the end ensure to cover all the features/responsibilities from the original architecture document $ARGUMENTS.

So that I can implment the bare minimum very first MVP using first document without any UI. Just the bare minimum backend.
Second document where I can improve the backend to support all features.
Third document where I can implement the bare minimum UI and integrate it with the backend.
Fourth document where I can improve UI to support all the features.

If there are no frontend element in the $ARGUMENTS document then just create 2 documents for backend.

Before writing to any file first show me the plan of seggregation for the whole architecture. Only upon my approval you go ahead and create the files. 
First show me a logical separation of all documents you are planning to create. 
Then before writing to any document first show me its summary and wait for my approval. Do it iteratively for all the documents you are creating.

**IMPORTANT AND MUST BE FOLLOWED AT ANY COST**
- Remember not to miss any feature from the original architecture document $ARGUMENTS and you must include all the features in newly discussed documents.
- You must not deviate from the original architecture plan. 
- You must not introduce any new concepts or technologies which is not already mentioned in the original architecture plan.
- Remember you are only grouping the features/responsibilities in their logical phases. You must not trim down the features/responsibilities itself to miss out the details.
- You must ensure consistency between original architecture plan and newly discussed documents. So that we are sure we are not missing out or adding any feature or responsibility.
- If there are no frontend elements included in the $ARGUMENTS document then just create 2 documents for backend.
