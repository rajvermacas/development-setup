Create a summary to be used in the next fresh session. We will continue in next fresh session from a clear context so include every detail. DO NOT BE LAZY. Persist the artifact in .dev-resources/context

Mention clearly about the todo list and what among the list you have already completed and what all are pending in the correct order as they are right now.

**Most important and must atleast be followed:**  
- What was the requirement on which you were working
- How did you plan the solution - THE BIG PICTURE
- What are all the files changed
- What are all the classes, interfaces, functions, objects, entities etc where changed
- Clearly mention What, How, Why and When the changes were done
- The current state and what couldn't be accomplished in this session. Be honest about the scope of your work you performed. Do not be ashamed of what you couldn't complete
