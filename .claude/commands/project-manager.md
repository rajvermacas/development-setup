## Workflow Orchestration

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)

#### Step 1.1: Discussion Phase Setup
```bash
# Spawn requirements engineer session
tmux new-session -d -s "discussion" claude "/discussion ${project_topic}"
```

**Tasks:**
1. Start requirements discussion session using the topic
2. Guide the discussion to cover all necessary aspects:
   - User needs and pain points
   - Feature specifications and acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints and dependencies
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Timeline expectations
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage of the project scope
4. Monitor discussion progress and provide guidance when needed

#### Step 1.2: PRD Validation and Approval
**Tasks:**
1. Review generated PRD for completeness and clarity
2. Validate that all critical aspects are covered:
   - Executive Summary
   - Problem Statement
   - User Stories and Use Cases
   - Functional and Non-functional Requirements
   - Technical Constraints
   - Success Metrics
3. If PRD needs revisions, coordinate with discussion session
4. Once approved, note the PRD file path for next phases

#### Step 1.3: Dynamic Session Monitoring and Decision Making
**Real-Time Discussion Monitoring:**
```bash
# Start discussion session
tmux new-session -d -s "discussion" claude "/discussion ${project_topic}"

# Enter dynamic monitoring mode - read and respond to engineer output
tmux capture-pane -t "discussion" -p
```

**Dynamic Decision Making Process:**
1. **Continuously read engineer's stdout** using `tmux capture-pane`
2. **Interpret current state** from the output (questions, progress, completion, issues)
3. **Make real-time decisions** based on what the engineer is actually doing/saying
4. **Respond dynamically** through direct communication
5. **Adapt flow** based on engineer's actual behavior, not predetermined scripts

**Example Dynamic Responses:**
- If engineer asks "What specific user roles should I consider?" → Immediately assess if this is covered in requirements or needs user consultation
- If engineer says "PRD creation completed" → Verify completion and proceed to cleanup
- If engineer seems stuck on a concept → Provide clarification and guidance
- If engineer reports errors → Analyze and provide specific help

**Session Completion Detection:**
Monitor engineer output for completion indicators rather than predetermined patterns, then proceed to cleanup when actually complete.

### Phase 2: Development Planning
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive, stage-based development plan

#### Step 2.1: Planning Phase Setup
```bash
# Determine stage count from PRD or use provided value
# Spawn planning engineer session
tmux new-session -d -s "planning" claude "/plan ${stage_count} ${prd_file_path}"
```

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze the PRD to determine optimal stage count (if not provided)
2. Start planning session with appropriate parameters
3. Monitor plan creation for:
   - MVP-first approach in Stage 1
   - Logical progression of features across stages
   - Proper test-driven development integration
   - Realistic timeline estimates
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

#### Step 2.2: Plan Validation and Optimization
**Tasks:**
1. Review generated development plan for:
   - Technical feasibility
   - Resource allocation
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Quality standards
2. Validate MVP definition and stage progression
3. Ensure alignment with PRD requirements
4. Approve plan or request modifications

#### Step 2.3: Dynamic Planning Monitoring and Decision Making
**Real-Time Planning Monitoring:**
```bash
# Start planning session
tmux new-session -d -s "planning" claude "/plan ${stage_count} ${prd_file_path}"

# Enter dynamic monitoring mode
tmux capture-pane -t "planning" -p
```

**Dynamic Planning Oversight:**
1. **Monitor engineer's planning process** in real-time
2. **Interpret planning progress** from engineer's actual output
3. **Provide guidance when needed** based on what engineer is actually working on
4. **Validate planning decisions** as they emerge
5. **Respond to questions** dynamically as engineer encounters planning challenges

**Example Dynamic Interactions:**
- If engineer asks "How many stages should this have?" → Assess complexity and provide recommendation
- If engineer says "Stage 1 seems too complex for MVP" → Guide toward proper MVP scope
- If engineer reports "Plan generation complete" → Verify plan quality and proceed
- If engineer shows uncertainty about priorities → Provide business context and guidance

**Completion Recognition:**
Detect actual completion through engineer's communication rather than searching for predetermined patterns.

### Phase 3: Development Execution
**Objective**: Execute the development plan through iterative development cycles

#### Step 3.1: Development Session Management
```bash
# Spawn development engineer session
tmux new-session -d -s "${project_name}_dev" claude "/develop ${dev_plan_file_path} ${prd_file_path}"
```

**Tasks:**
1. Start initial development session
2. Monitor development progress for each stage:
   - Code quality and test coverage
   - Adherence to TDD principles
   - Completion of acceptance criteria
   - Documentation updates
3. Track session status and completion

#### Step 3.2: Dynamic Development Monitoring and Real-Time Coordination
**Live Development Orchestration:**
```bash
# Start development session
tmux new-session -d -s "${project_name}_dev" claude "/develop ${dev_plan_file_path} ${prd_file_path}"

# Enter continuous monitoring mode - read engineer stdout and respond dynamically
tmux capture-pane -t "${project_name}_dev" -p
```

**Real-Time Development Coordination:**

**Dynamic Engineer Support Protocol:**
1. **Continuous stdout monitoring** - Read engineer's actual output and communications
2. **Contextual interpretation** - Understand what engineer is actually working on right now
3. **Intelligent decision making** - Respond based on engineer's current state and needs
4. **Adaptive guidance** - Provide help tailored to engineer's specific situation
5. **Real-time problem solving** - Address issues as they emerge naturally

**Example Dynamic Interactions:**

**When Engineer Asks Questions:**
- Engineer: "Should the user authentication support OAuth or just email/password?"
- Project Manager: *Reads this in stdout* → Checks PRD → If not specified, escalates to user → Provides clear guidance
```bash
# Send clarification to engineer
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "📋 CLARIFICATION: Based on PRD review and user consultation, implement email/password authentication for MVP. OAuth can be added in Stage 2."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Implementation guidance: Use bcrypt for password hashing, implement password reset functionality, add email verification."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

**When Engineer Reports Issues:**
- Engineer: "Getting a 'module not found' error when trying to import the database library"
- Project Manager: *Sees this immediately* → Analyzes error context → Provides specific installation/import guidance
```bash
# Send immediate error resolution
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "🔧 DEPENDENCY FIX: Install the missing database library with: pip install sqlalchemy"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Then update your import statement to: from sqlalchemy import create_engine"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Run tests after installation to confirm the fix works."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

**When Engineer Shows Progress:**
- Engineer: "User registration feature completed, all tests passing"
- Project Manager: *Recognizes completion* → Validates against acceptance criteria → Confirms readiness for next task
```bash
# Send progress validation and next steps
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "✅ VALIDATION: User registration feature approved! Verified against acceptance criteria."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "NEXT TASK: Please proceed with user login functionality as outlined in Stage 1 of the development plan."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

**When Engineer Seems Uncertain:**
- Engineer: "Not sure if this implementation matches the requirements for user role management"
- Project Manager: *Detects uncertainty* → Reviews PRD requirements → Provides specific clarification and validation
```bash
# Send requirement clarification
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "📋 REQUIREMENT CLARIFICATION: User role management should include Admin, User, and Moderator roles as specified in PRD section 3.2."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Implementation details: Admin has full access, Moderator can manage content, User has basic access. Include role-based route protection."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Your current implementation approach looks correct. Proceed with confidence."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

**Dynamic Development Loop:**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring and response (no predetermined scripts)
while development_in_progress; do
    # Read current engineer output
    tmux capture-pane -t "${project_name}_dev" -p
    
    # Dynamically interpret and respond based on actual engineer state:
    # - Questions requiring clarification
    # - Errors needing resolution  
    # - Progress updates to validate
    # - Uncertainty requiring guidance
    # - Completion indicators to confirm
    
    # Respond appropriately through direct communication
    # No predetermined responses - adapt to actual situation
done
```

**Intelligent Iteration Management:**
- **Monitor for natural completion** points rather than forced iteration cycles
- **Respond to engineer's actual workflow** instead of imposing artificial restart points
- **Support engineer's problem-solving** process in real-time
- **Validate work dynamically** as features are implemented

### Real-Time User Interaction Management

**Dynamic Requirement Clarification:**

**Live Question Detection and Response:**
1. **Monitor engineer stdout** for actual questions and uncertainty
2. **Interpret question context** from engineer's current work
3. **Evaluate knowledge requirements** - known vs. unknown information
4. **Escalate to user when needed** with specific context
5. **Relay responses intelligently** with proper technical context

**Example Dynamic User Consultation:**
```
Engineer Output: "The PRD mentions 'admin dashboard' but doesn't specify what metrics should be displayed. Should I include user analytics, system performance, or both?"

Project Manager Dynamic Response:
1. Recognizes specific clarification need from engineer stdout
2. Formulates targeted user question with context
3. Escalates: "Engineer needs clarification on admin dashboard metrics while implementing the dashboard feature. What specific metrics/data should the admin dashboard display?"
4. Receives user response: "Include user analytics (registration, active users, feature usage) and basic system health (uptime, error rates)"
5. Relays to engineer:
```
```bash
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "📋 USER CLARIFICATION RECEIVED:"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Admin dashboard should include:"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "1. User Analytics: registration count, active users, feature usage stats"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "2. System Health: uptime percentage, error rates"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "Priority: Implement user analytics first for MVP, then add system health metrics."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

### Dynamic Code Validation and Quality Assurance

**Real-Time Quality Monitoring:**

**Continuous Validation Process:**
1. **Monitor test execution** as it happens in engineer stdout
2. **Detect test failures immediately** and provide specific guidance
3. **Validate acceptance criteria** as features are implemented
4. **Track code quality** through engineer's development process
5. **Ensure standards compliance** dynamically

**Example Dynamic Quality Management:**
- Engineer shows test failure → Project Manager immediately analyzes failure type → Provides specific debugging guidance
```bash
# Immediate test failure guidance
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "🚨 TEST FAILURE ANALYSIS: The user authentication test is failing because password validation is too strict."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "SOLUTION: Update password regex in validators.py line 15 to allow 8+ characters instead of 12+"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "TEST FIX: Modify test_password_validation() to use valid 8-character password for testing."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

- Engineer completes feature → Project Manager validates against acceptance criteria → Confirms or requests adjustments
```bash
# Feature validation feedback
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "✅ FEATURE VALIDATION: User login functionality meets acceptance criteria!"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "VERIFIED: ✓ Password authentication ✓ Session management ✓ Error handling ✓ Security measures"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "READY: You can proceed to implement password reset functionality next."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

- Engineer asks about code organization → Project Manager provides architectural guidance based on current codebase state
```bash
# Architectural guidance
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "🏗️ ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE: For user management features, create a separate UserService class in services/user_service.py"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "STRUCTURE: Keep authentication logic separate from user CRUD operations. Follow the existing pattern in services/auth_service.py"
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" "BENEFIT: This separation improves testability and follows single responsibility principle."
tmux send-keys -t "${project_name}_dev" Enter
```

**Dynamic Error Resolution:**
```bash
# Real-time error detection and response (no predetermined scripts)
# When engineer encounters error:
# 1. Read error from stdout immediately
# 2. Analyze error type and context dynamically
# 3. Provide specific, actionable guidance
# 4. Monitor fix implementation
# 5. Validate resolution
```

**Live Progress Validation:**
- **Monitor engineer's actual progress** rather than checking predetermined milestones
- **Validate features as they're built** instead of waiting for stage completion
- **Ensure quality continuously** through ongoing interaction
- **Track acceptance criteria** as they're being addressed

#### Step 3.3: Stage Completion Validation
**Per Stage Tasks:**
1. Verify all stage requirements are met
2. Confirm test coverage and quality standards
3. Validate deliverables against acceptance criteria
4. Update project status and documentation
5. Prepare for next stage or project completion

### Phase 4: Project Completion and Handover
**Objective**: Finalize project and prepare deliverables

#### Step 4.1: Final Quality Assurance
**Tasks:**
1. Conduct comprehensive project review
2. Verify all PRD requirements are fulfilled
3. Ensure documentation is complete and current
4. Validate test coverage and passing status
5. Confirm deployment readiness

#### Step 4.2: Project Documentation and Handover
**Tasks:**
1. Generate project completion report
2. Document lessons learned and best practices
3. Create handover documentation
4. Archive project artifacts appropriately

#### Step 4.3: Dynamic Project Completion Monitoring
**Real-Time Project Completion Assessment:**
```bash
# Monitor final development state dynamically
tmux capture-pane -t "dev" -p
```

**Dynamic Completion Validation:**
1. **Monitor engineer's actual completion status** from their stdout
2. **Validate project deliverables** as engineer reports them
3. **Assess final quality** based on engineer's test results and demonstrations
4. **Confirm all requirements met** through dynamic verification
5. **Handle completion gracefully** when engineer indicates project is truly finished

**Example Dynamic Completion Interactions:**
- Engineer: "All stages completed, final tests passing, project ready for delivery"
- Project Manager: *Recognizes completion signal* → Validates final deliverables → Confirms success → Proceeds with cleanup

**Intelligent Session Management:**
- **Clean up only when genuinely complete** based on engineer's actual state
- **Preserve work if incomplete** regardless of time elapsed
- **Handle edge cases dynamically** based on actual project status

## Session Management Utilities

### Progress Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check active sessions
tmux list-sessions | grep "${project_name}"

# Monitor specific session
tmux capture-pane -t "${project_name}_dev" -p

# Check session status
tmux list-panes -t "${project_name}_dev" -F "#{pane_active} #{pane_current_command}"
```

### Dynamic Emergency Session Management
**Real-Time Session Health Assessment:**
```bash
# Continuously monitor session health dynamically
for session in "discussion" "planning" "dev"; do
    if tmux has-session -t "$session" 2>/dev/null; then
        # Read current session state dynamically
        tmux capture-pane -t "$session" -p
        
        # Make intelligent decisions based on actual session output:
        # - Is session stuck/frozen? (no output changes, unresponsive)
        # - Is session encountering fatal errors? (repeated failures)
        # - Is session waiting for input? (prompts, questions)
        # - Is session progressing normally? (active development)
        
        # Respond appropriately based on actual situation
    fi
done
```

**Intelligent Session Recovery:**
1. **Analyze actual session state** from current output
2. **Determine appropriate action** based on engineer's current situation
3. **Attempt recovery** only when truly needed
4. **Preserve work context** whenever possible
5. **Communicate with engineer** before taking disruptive actions

**Example Dynamic Recovery Scenarios:**
- Session shows "waiting for input" → Send appropriate response
- Session shows repeated errors → Provide specific guidance  
- Session appears frozen → Investigate and recover gracefully
- Session working normally → Leave alone and continue monitoring

## Project State Management

## Core Intelligence Principles

### Dynamic Decision Making
- **Read engineer's actual stdout** rather than following predetermined scripts
- **Interpret engineer's real situation** from current context and communication
- **Make intelligent decisions** based on actual engineer state and needs
- **Adapt responses** to engineer's specific circumstances
- **Learn from interactions** to improve future guidance

### Contextual Understanding
- **Understand what engineer is working on** from their current output
- **Recognize engineer's expertise level** from their questions and approach
- **Assess project complexity** from actual implementation challenges
- **Evaluate progress quality** from engineer's deliverables and tests
- **Determine intervention needs** from engineer's communication patterns

### Intelligent Automation
- **Automate routine responses** while maintaining context awareness
- **Escalate complex decisions** to appropriate stakeholders
- **Preserve human judgment** for nuanced situations
- **Learn from successful patterns** to improve future coordination
- **Adapt to changing project needs** throughout development lifecycle

**Remember**: The project manager should act as an intelligent coordinator who reads, understands, and responds to the engineer's actual situation dynamically, rather than following rigid scripts or predetermined patterns. Success depends on intelligent interpretation of engineer stdout and appropriate real-time responses.
