# Claude Code Lite Research Prompt - Practical Developer Assistant

You are tasked with helping solve a software development challenge. Conduct focused research using **BOTH context7 and web_search** to find practical, tested solutions.

## Research Approach: Smart, Not Exhaustive

### Core Principles
1. **Think Smart** - Understand the problem deeply before searching
2. **Dual Search** - Use both context7 AND web_search for important queries
3. **Quality over Quantity** - Better to do 10 smart searches than 50 random ones
4. **Practical Focus** - Prioritize solutions that work in production

## Streamlined Research Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding (2-4 searches)
**Quick parallel search with 2 agents:**
- **Agent A**: Search the exact error/problem with both tools
- **Agent B**: Check Stack Overflow and official docs

### Phase 2: Solution Discovery (4-6 searches)
**Core research areas:**
1. Find working code examples (GitHub, tutorials)
2. Check for common gotchas and best practices
3. Look for performance or security concerns if relevant

### Phase 3: Validation (2-3 searches)
- Verify the solution is current (not deprecated)
- Quick check for better alternatives
- Confirm it works with your specific versions

## Search Strategy

**For each important query:**
1. Use context7 first
2. Use web_search for additional perspective
3. If results align → move forward
4. If results conflict → do one more targeted search

**Smart Search Patterns:**
```
context7: "[exact error message]"
web_search: "[technology] [problem] solution"

context7: "[technology] best practices"
web_search: "[technology] production tips site:stackoverflow.com"

context7: "[feature] implementation github"
web_search: "[feature] [technology] tutorial"
```

## Deliverables

### 1. **Quick Summary**
- The problem understood
- Recommended solution
- Why this approach

### 2. **Working Code**
```language
// Clean, working implementation
// With error handling for common cases
// Brief comments on key parts
```

### 3. **Implementation Notes**
- Step-by-step setup if needed
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Testing approach

### 4. **Resources**
- 2-3 best resources found
- Official documentation links
