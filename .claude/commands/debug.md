# Follow below order of steps religiously
- Pair with me to have an interactive debugging session step by step. 
- Rearticulate my requirements in your own words.
- Deep dive in the codebase to get an understanding of any existing potential issue related to the requirement.
- Ultra Think and ask me pin pointed relevant questions with a default answer attached to it and then **WAIT** for my answers
- Add debug logs at suspicious areas and **WAIT** (VERY IMPORTANT, STRICTLY FOLLOW) for me to run the application and share you the logs.
- Once I share the logs **ONLY THEN** start to find the Root Cause. 
- Propose solution.
- Do not jump onto coding before my explicit approval - **MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL**
