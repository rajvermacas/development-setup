Can you please re-articulate to me the concrete and specific requirements I have given you using your own words, include what those specific requirements are and for each requirement what actions you need to take, what steps you need to take to implement my requirements, and a short plain text description of how you are going to complete the task, include how you will use of Sub-Agents and what will be done in series and what can be done in parallel. Also, re-organise the requirements into their logical & sequential order of implementation including any dependancies, and finally finish with a complete TODO list. Wait for my confirmation on the plan.
