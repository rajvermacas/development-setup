- Draft the final architecture plan with all the technolgies involved. 
- Remember to include all the discussed technologies involved, data flows, execution flows, sequence flow diagrams or any other discussed visual representations.
- Refrain from writing actual code in the markdown artifact. Instead try to write the discussed:
    - algorithms
    - concepts
    - technologies
    - logical classes
    - uml diagrams
    - responsibilities
    - dependencies
    - api contracts
    - integration points
    - industry best practices
    - designs
    - flowcharts
    - data flow
    - execution flow
    - sequence diagrams
    - class diagrams
    - and any other information or visual representations that signifies:
        - Architecture & Structure
        - system boundaries
        - architectural layers
        - components and sub-systems
        - modules and domains
        - bounded contexts
        - responsibility segregation
        - dependency direction
        - coupling and cohesion
        - extension points
        - plug-in points
        - state transition diagrams
        - component interaction maps
        - dependency graphs
        - timing diagrams
        - swimlane diagrams
        - system context diagrams
        - conceptual schemas
        - interaction timelines
        - Interaction & Integration
        - communication patterns
        - request–response semantics
        - asynchronous flows
        - event-driven interactions
        - message contracts
        - idempotency guarantees
        - retry and timeout behavior
        - backpressure strategy
        - versioning strategy
        - compatibility rules

- The intent is to produce design-level documentation, not implementation. The markdown artifact should read like a thinking blueprint: how the system works, why decisions exist, and how pieces interact.

- Create a markdown artifact in .dev-resources/architecture/ directory and cover all the details which we discussed about the finalised approach.
