- Draft the final architecture plan with all the technology stack involved. 
- Remember to include all the discussed technologies involved, data flows, execution flows, sequence flow diagrams or any other discussed visual representations.
- Refrain from writing actual code in the markdown artifact. Instead try to write the discussed:
    - algorithms
    - concepts
    - technologies
    - logical classes
    - uml diagrams
    - responsibilities
    - dependencies
    - api contracts
    - integration points
    - industry best practices
    - designs
    - flowcharts
    - data flow
    - execution flow
    - sequence diagrams
    - class diagrams
    - and any other discussed information or visual representations

- The intent is to produce design-level documentation. The markdown artifact should read like a thinking blueprint: how the system works, why decisions exist, and how pieces interact.

- Create a markdown artifact in .dev-resources/architecture/ directory and cover all the details which we discussed about the finalised approach.
