I want you to act as an expert UI developer and create a **fully functional, minimal HTML-based style guide** for my requirement at the path `.dev-resources/ui-style-guides` directory. The guide should:

1. **Be self-contained HTML** (no external CSS except Tailwind CDN, no app logic).
2. Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
3. Include **light mode** and **dark mode** variants (preferably using `dark:` classes).
4. Clearly demonstrate **all components** in one HTML page:

   * Color palette swatches
   * Typography styles (headings, paragraphs, small text, code snippets)
   * Buttons (primary, secondary, danger, disabled, hover states)
   * Chat bubbles (user, AI)
   * Form inputs (text, select, checkbox, radio, textarea)
   * Tables (with header, hover states, striped rows)
   * Cards / panels
   * Notifications / toasts / alerts
   * Badges / tags
5. Have **section headings** labeling each component.
6. Be **minimal but visually clear**, focusing on how each component looks.
7. Use placeholder content where necessary (lorem ipsum, example tables, fake buttons).

At the start of the output, include a **brief description** of the style guide and how to toggle dark mode.

When I give you project-specific preferences (colors, fonts, tone, layout), apply them to the HTML output. If no preferences are given, use a **clean, modern default** style with Tailwind's default palette and Inter font.
